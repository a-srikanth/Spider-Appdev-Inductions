Spider Appdev Task 2

Features of this app:

-Implemented gesture control for image transition using the proximity sensor.
-Animation effect between image transition.
-These above two features can be controlled through the Settings menu.Each of these features can be
 toggled independently.
-If gesture control is disabled a play button is visible to play the slideshow. On enabling the gesture 
 control feature, the play button is made to disappear and the image transition is controlled solely by
 hand movement.
-It contains music tracks which can be played and stopped independently without effecting the UI.

NOTE:
-It has come to notice that the sensor does not work properly on some phones. So far I have tested this
 app on both MotoG3(Marshmallow API level 23) and SamsungGalaxyS4(Lollipop API level 21) and all 
 the features are working. However on an older phone running Android JellyBean(api level 16) the 
 settings menu was not visible. For the same reason I have set the minSdkversion as 19 , hence it may
 not function properly on an older phone. 
 I would recommend for proper functioning of all the features, do use a phone having an API level 20
 or above.

Thank You!!
